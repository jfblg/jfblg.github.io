      <description>Pytest Intro Not even a year ago I started on a position, where I also work on software and system testing. There is a lot to comprehend and a lot to learn. Besides specific topic and tasks I&amp;rsquo;d like to also extend my general knowledge. This is why I started to read and implement the examples/exercises from the book Python Testing with pytest written by Brian Okken. This blog post will probably evolve and I&amp;rsquo;d like to have here my notes taken from this book.</description>
