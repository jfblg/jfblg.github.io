      <description>Learning Go - Notes Notes which I took during my learning. It&#39;d be great if they would also help you.
Go is statically written (type of every variable must be defined), pass by value (whenever you pass an argument into a function, Go creates a copy of each argument, and these copies are used inside of the function) programming language.
Go workspace and basics  MUST READ DOCUMENT  Syntax Variable declaration   if you define a variable within the if statement(condition) it is valid only there.</description>
