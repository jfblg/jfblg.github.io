      <description>Prevent grep from showing up in &amp;lsquo;ps&amp;rsquo; output You don&#39;t want the grep process itself to show up in the list of process (ps) when filtering with the grep.
In the example below, the second line should not appear.
$ ps -few | grep nvim vagrant 12337 11456 0 14:55 pts/6 00:00:00 nvim vagrant 12340 4979 0 14:55 pts/3 00:00:00 grep --color=auto nvim How to to achieve it? You can use &amp;lsquo;-v&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;&amp;ndash;invert-match&amp;rsquo; switch of grep as follows:</description>

      <description>Learning Go - Notes Notes which I took during my learning. It&#39;d be great if they would also help you.
Go is statically written (type of every variable must be defined), pass by value (whenever you pass an argument into a function, Go creates a copy of each argument, and these copies are used inside of the function) programming language.
Go workspace and basics  MUST READ DOCUMENT  Syntax Variable declaration   if you define a variable within the if statement(condition) it is valid only there.</description>
