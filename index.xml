      <title>Enable SSH key based authentication on Synology NAS</title>

      <description>Introduction In this post I&amp;rsquo;d like to describe how I solved a little issue I had with my Synology NAS. Synology NAS run a Linux based system, AFAIK it&amp;rsquo;s IIRC which is a customized Debian fork. To copy files from/to NAS I also use SFTP, SCP or SSHFS, both based on OpenSSH. To eliminate the need to enter my password and to improve security I always prefer to use SSH key based authentication in combination with an SSH agent.</description>

      <description>Pytest Intro Not even a year ago I started on a position, where I also work on software and system testing. There is a lot to comprehend and a lot to learn. Besides specific topic and tasks I&amp;rsquo;d like to also extend my general knowledge. This is why I started to read and implement the examples/exercises from the book Python Testing with pytest written by Brian Okken. This blog post will probably evolve and I&amp;rsquo;d like to have here my notes taken from this book.</description>

      <description>Git Commands - My Cheatsheet I am using git almost every time a I work on a computer. Somehow I find the CLI interface the quickest, especially in combination with aliases provided by oh-my-zsh git plugin. This blog post provides however full commands, they are here mainly for my reference as I don&amp;rsquo;t use very often majority of them.
Clone  Clone a content of a repository into a directory (Note, if the directory does not exist yet, it will be automatically created)  git clone URL bar Remotes  List all remotes of the branch  git remote -v  Add a new remote called myremote  git remote add myremote URL git fetch myremote Branches  Create a new branch which is a copy of the current one  git checkout -b &amp;lt;name-of-new-branch&amp;gt;  if a remote &amp;lsquo;myremote&amp;rsquo; has a special branch, use &amp;ndash;track to configure sync with the this remote branch  git checkout -b &amp;lt;name-of-new-branch&amp;gt; -- track myremote/&amp;lt;remote-branch&amp;gt;  Switch to another existing branch  git checkout &amp;lt;name-of-another-branch&amp;gt;  Switch to another branch, which has not been yet used locally  git fetch git checkout -b &amp;lt;branch-name&amp;gt; &amp;lt;remote&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;branch-name&amp;gt; # or shorthand: git checkout -t &amp;lt;remote&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;branch-name&amp;gt; Staging  Stage a file  git add &amp;lt;file-name&amp;gt;  Stage all files in the current directory recursively  git add .</description>

      <description>Prevent grep from showing up in &amp;lsquo;ps&amp;rsquo; output You don&amp;rsquo;t want the grep process itself to show up in the list of process (ps) when filtering with the grep.
In the example below, the second line should not appear.
$ ps -few | grep nvim vagrant 12337 11456 0 14:55 pts/6 00:00:00 nvim vagrant 12340 4979 0 14:55 pts/3 00:00:00 grep --color=auto nvim How to to achieve it? You can use &amp;lsquo;-v&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;&amp;ndash;invert-match&amp;rsquo; switch of grep as follows:</description>

      <description>Learning Go - Notes Notes which I took during my learning. It&amp;rsquo;d be great if they would also help you.
Go is statically written (type of every variable must be defined), pass by value (whenever you pass an argument into a function, Go creates a copy of each argument, and these copies are used inside of the function) programming language.
Go workspace and basics  MUST READ DOCUMENT  Syntax Variable declaration   if you define a variable within the if statement(condition) it is valid only there.</description>
