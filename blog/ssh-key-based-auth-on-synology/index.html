              <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>In this post I&rsquo;d like to describe how I solved a little issue I had with my Synology NAS. Synology NAS run a Linux based system, AFAIK it&rsquo;s IIRC which is a customized Debian fork. To copy files from/to NAS I also use SFTP, SCP or SSHFS, both based on OpenSSH. To eliminate the need to enter my password and to improve security I always prefer to use SSH key based authentication in combination with an SSH agent. So, I want to use a SSH key based authentication also when connecting to my Synology NAS. As usually I copied my public SSH key to <code>$HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> and expected that SSH key based authentication is now enabled. It wasn&rsquo;t working however. I was asked to enter my password during the connection initiation. The rest of article describes how I solved it.</p>
<p>To summarize, my issue was: SSH key based authentication used when connecting to my NAS, even though my public SSH key was in the file <code>$HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> on the NAS.</p>
<h2 id="step-1">Step 1</h2>
<p>Enable  <code>verbose</code> mode on SSH client i.e. use <code>-v</code> switch.</p>
<pre><code>ssh -v nas
...
debug1: Offering public key: cardno:000500007847
...
</code></pre><p>I could see that the client offered my SSH key, but the server did&rsquo;t accept it. Therefore, the authentication method failed over to a password based. My client works fine.
Now, I&rsquo;m sure that issue is on the server side.</p>
<h2 id="step2">Step2</h2>
<p>After I authenticated with my password, the following log message appeared in the console.</p>
<pre><code>debug1: Remote: Ignored authorized keys: bad ownership or modes for file /volume1/homes/admin/.ssh/authorized_keys
debug1: Remote: Ignored authorized keys: bad ownership or modes for file /volume1/homes/admin/.ssh/authorized_keys
</code></pre><p>This is helfull debug message. Now I know that</p>
<ol>
<li>Key based authentication is enabled on server i.e. <code>PubkeyAuthentication yes</code> option is set in <code>sshd_config</code></li>
<li>Access rights to the <code>authorized_keys</code> file is not correctly set.  After issuing  the <code>ls -la ~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code>, the file had following access rights configured.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>-rwxrwxrwx 1 admin users 1490 Dec 13 08:41 authorized_keys
</code></pre><p>I still haven&rsquo;t understood that, why is like that by default. I think that the <code>authorized_keys</code> file wasn&rsquo;t created by myself. Instead I assume that it was created when my account was provisioned by DSM. I tried to figure out if a file creation time is stored in metadata. It is not. <code>stat /path/to/file</code> shows <code>Birth: -</code>, which is like that on all Linux sytemts. Birth timestamp is not stored.  Also default umask is set to 0022, so if I would create it, the access rights would be 0644. Luckilly, the access rights can be changed pretty easy and this is what I did in the next step.</p>
<h2 id="step3">Step3</h2>
<p>Change of the access rights for &lsquo;authorized_keys&rsquo;.
After searching in internet and reading sshd man pages, I configured the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>chmod 0700 $HOME/.ssh</code> - only user can change into directory</li>
<li><code>chmod 0600 $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> - only user can view or edit the file</li>
</ul>
<p>This has solved my issue and SSH key based authentication started to work.</p>
<h2 id="further-findings">Further findings</h2>
<p>As almost always, I learned/realized also other things. Following are the ones I learned in this case.</p>
<h3 id="strictmodes">StrictModes</h3>
<p>The reason why sshd also check the access rights configured on <code>authorized_keys</code> is <strong>StrictModes</strong> option in <code>sshd_config</code> which is (by default) set to <strong>yes</strong>.
Excertp from <em>man sshd_config</em>:</p>
<pre><code>StrictModes
             Specifies whether sshd(8) should check file modes and ownership of the user's files and home directory before accepting login.  This is normally desirable because novices
             sometimes accidentally leave their directory or files world-writable. The default is yes.  Note that this does not apply to ChrootDirectory, whose permissions and owner‚Äê
             ship are checked unconditionally.
</code></pre><h3 id="tokens">TOKENS</h3>
<p>SSH provides a tokens which can be expanded dynamically by sshd and give a certain flexibility when configuring certain options. Full documentation is under <em>man sshd_config</em> in section <em>TOKENS</em>. Important note is that not all tokens work with every configuration option, which is also well described. E.g. in case of <em>AuthorizedKeysFile</em> you can use
<code>AuthorizedKeysFile accepts the tokens %%, %h, %U, and %u.</code></p>
<ul>
<li>%h - The home directory of the user.</li>
<li>%U- The numeric user ID of the target user.</li>
<li>%u - The username.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example in case of Synology NAS, I could specify
<code> AuthorizedKeysFile  /var/services/homes/%u/.ssh/authorized_keys</code></p>
<h3 id="agnostic-restart-of-a-daemon">Agnostic restart of a daemon</h3>
<p>After sshd_config changes, I needed to make sshd daemon to apply new configuration. I usually do it by restarting a (sshd) daemon.
DSM does not use the systemd as its init process, so commalds like <code>systemctl restart sshd</code> won&rsquo;t work. Moreover, when I tried out <code>service sshd restart</code>, it also didn&rsquo;t work. I found out there is another way, which is agnostic from the init process. Find out the process ID of a deamon e.g. sshd, then send it the SIGHUP signal, which will force the process to relaod the configuration. Both steps can be done in one command:</p>
<pre><code>sudo kill -HUP `cat /run/sshd.pid`
</code></pre>
